**Title:** Custom Discord Bot for League of Legends Players with an Economy System

The custom Discord bot designed specifically for League of Legends players comes equipped with an economy system. It is written in Python3, utilizing the Nextcord library to create the bot. Each line starting with '@bot.slash_command' represents a slash command within Discord, each with its own unique functions. For instance, the '/profile' command allows registered users to view their Discord nickname, rank, and current balance.

The bot was developed to meet the specific requirements and desires of the customer.

**NOTE:** The Discord token ('DISCORD_TOKEN') is stored in a separate file named '.env' to maintain privacy. It is crucial never to share this token to ensure the privacy and security of not only the bot but also our data.

**Let's explore some of the commands available:**

(I added a 2-hour cooldown so that users won't spam the channel.)

Moreover, specific commands can only be used in particular channels based on their Discord channel IDs, ensuring proper usage and organization within the server environment.
